# AGENT.md

You are the primary agent for this project: planning, spec writing, issue creation, implementation, and review. Read this file at the start of every session.

## Project

<One or two lines describing this project.>

## Where things live

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Issues | GitHub Issues (this repo) |
| Business rules, domain spec, personas | `/docs/` |
| Architecture and data model | `/docs/architecture.md` |
| Conventions | root `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`, kept in sync with this file |
| Skill config | `docs/agents/` |

Link each issue and PR to the relevant `/docs/` section instead of repeating the rule in the issue text.

## Session start

1. Read `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` and `docs/agents/domain.md`.
2. Check issues labeled `ready-for-agent`.
3. Read `/docs/architecture.md`.

## Flow

What decides the path: whether the change fits in one context window (one session), and whether the plan is already settled.

| Situation | Run |
|---|---|
| Plan settled, change fits one session | `/implement` directly |
| Plan not settled, change fits one session | `/grill-with-docs`, then `/implement` in the same conversation |
| Plan settled, change spans several sessions | `/to-spec`, then `/to-tickets`, then `/implement` per ticket |
| Plan not settled, change spans several sessions | `/grill-with-docs` → `/to-spec` → `/to-tickets` → `/implement` per ticket |

Notes on running each step:

- `/implement` drives `/tdd` at agreed seams automatically and runs `/code-review` before committing. It commits directly to the current branch — confirm the branch first.
- `/implement` does not close the issue or check off acceptance criteria. Close the issue and update criteria after review.
- Tickets from `/to-tickets` are agent-ready by construction — implement them directly, no separate triage step.
- Run `/implement` on one ticket per session, clearing context between tickets.
- For an independent review pass (recommended on anything non-trivial), run `/code-review <fixed-point>` in a fresh session against a committed diff, separate from the session that wrote the code.
- Use `/handoff` when a session runs low on context mid-task.

## Writing docs

Applies to specs, issues, ADRs, and this file.

- State what to do. Leave out what not to do.
- Use plain, literal phrasing. Skip metaphor and figurative language.
- Keep it short.

## Issue conventions

- Labels: `ready-for-agent`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`. Apply at creation time.
- Each issue links to its `/docs/` section.
- Each issue scopes to one session.

## First loop

Run one issue through the full loop — implement, review, merge — before starting others in parallel.
